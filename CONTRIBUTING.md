## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Security First
Security is our top priority. When contributing, please:

- Never commit sensitive data or credentials

- Report security issues privately

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Create new branch with the name of the feature or fix you are working on
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
5. Ensure the test suite passes
6. Make sure your code lints

  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
